This directory contains python implementations of the exercises in Eric Tarr's [*Hack Audio: An Introduction to Computer Programming and Digital Signal Processing in Matlab*](https://www.mathworks.com/academia/books/hack-audio-tarr.html).

Why _killaudio_? The name _Hack Audio_ reminded me of the [comic book series Kill Audio](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Kill-Audio/Claudio-Sanchez/9781608862924) by Coheed and Cambria's frontman, Claudio Sanchez.
