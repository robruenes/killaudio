# Chapter 4: Programming Environment

Chapter 4 of *Hack Audio* describes the Matlab programming environment.
Python doesn't have an exact analog (disregarding IPython notebooks).

If exercises later in the book prove to require extensive navigation of some topics covered in the chapter (like navigating directory structure or debugging, for example), I'll come back to this directory and add code snippets to help.
